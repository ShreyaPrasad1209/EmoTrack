## Exporting your Twitter bookmarks in markdown file


I build side projects when I get random ideas ðŸ˜› I got this one when I accidently opened my bookmarks and saw hundreds of unopened tweets! Bookmarks feature helps you save the tweets privately. 

How about exporting those bookmarks in a file and maybe use it in a web application? It should be noted that Twitter DOES NOT provide an API to access the bookmarks. I will be sharing the steps I performed, any challenges I faced etc. 

This project is open for contributions ðŸŽ‰
